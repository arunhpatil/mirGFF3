**Introduction**

As discussed here: https://github.com/miRTop/incubator/issues/10 we've defined a GFF3 format for output of small RNA pipelines focused on miRNA data currently.

This output is based on the current GFF3 definition: https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/Specifications/blob/master/gff3.md

Note: Keep in mind this is for the output of a pipeline, so we know there will be bias toward methodology, but the idea is to put enough information to be able to re-analyze or filter sequences using information described here. As well, it would be a proxy for downstream analysis or packages.

**Advantages**

* Developers of miRNA detection and annotation tools can open their results to other tools and communities using this format.

* Developers of downstream analysis can use the output from any supported annotation tool to work on variant calling, visualization, filtering, ensemble strategy to call isomiRs, etc ...
